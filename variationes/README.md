# variationes

This directory is the project's sketchbook:
when some piece needs a revision, the file containing it is copied here
and ideas are explored. Thus many chants appear here in several different
versions - some unfinished, some totally ugly, ...

The script [updatefromvar.ly](https://github.com/igneus/In-adiutorium/blob/master/nastroje/updatefromvar.rb)
is then used to automatically copy the variant selected for general
use to it's proper place in the main tree.

Between 2012 and 2015 this work had been done in a separate branch,
called the same - variationes - which can [still be found in this repository](https://github.com/igneus/In-adiutorium/tree/variationes)
for the case it was needed some day.
