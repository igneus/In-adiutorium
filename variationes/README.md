# variationes

This directory is the project's sketchbook:
when some piece needs a revision, the file containing it is copied here
and ideas are explored. Thus many chants appear here in several different
versions - some unfinished, some totally ugly, ...

Between 2012 and 2015 this work had been done in a separate branch,
called the same - variationes - which can still be found in this repository
for the case it was needed some day.
