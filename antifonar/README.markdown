# Antiphonal for the liturgy of hours #

* This branch is an attempt to integrate the festal psalter
in the regular psalter, so that the festal psalter is never more needed. *

To be able to compile the volumes of the Antiphonal,
you need:

* Ruby 1.9 & rake (not Ruby 1.8!)
* LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, pdfjam, support of the Czech language in babel
* LilyPond 2.14.2 (not 2.15!)

Run 'rake -T' in this directory to see all the stuff you can compile.
