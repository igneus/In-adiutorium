# Antiphonal for the liturgy of hours #

To be able to compile the volumes of the Antiphonal,
you need:

* Ruby 1.9 & rake (not Ruby 1.8!)
* LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, pdfjam, support of the Czech language in babel
* LilyPond 2.14.2 or newer then 2.15.36 (There was a regression in 2.15.34
  making many volumes of the antiphonal uncompilable)

Run 'rake -T' in this directory to see all the stuff you can compile.
